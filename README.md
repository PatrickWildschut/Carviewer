# Carviewer for Raspberry PI 4
This program uses my knowledge from the old Cruise-and-Launch-Control-Arduino project. That ran on an Arduino Uno, this runs on an Raspberry PI.
The reason for this upgrade is that I wanted to have Apple Carplay in my car, while also keeping my cruise control and other functionalities. 
Thus this repository is a mix of Apple Carplay and Cruise-and-Launch-Control-Arduino but now for the Raspberry PI!
